# Solar-efficiency-data
The program requests the collector area of a solar panel in mÂ². It then outputs the lowest effective temperature that can be utilized, along with the solar energy percentage contribution in the total energy requirement. The subsequent lines of code also plot the solar energy contribution with respect to the collector area. The program is specific to the month of May each year.
